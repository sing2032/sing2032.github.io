            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am Jasleen, a student at Algonquin College. I am enrolled in the program of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. It is currently my 1<sup>st</sup> semester, and I am looking forward to exploring this course further in the coming months. Before coming to Canada, I had completed my Senior Secondary education back in India, in the stream of fine arts.</p>

            <p>I would like to say that I am an artistic person and enjoy art a lot. I do a bit of digital art when I get the time. I also bought a drawing tablet a year back doing art commissions. It was about $400, and it was a <em>huge</em> accomplishment for me at that time.</p>
